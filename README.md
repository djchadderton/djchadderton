David Chadderton is from Manchester, England. He took over as [British Theatre Guide](https://www.britishtheatreguide.info/) editor from founder Peter Lathan in 2012 after converting the web site from thousands of hand-coded HTML pages to a database-backed site powered by Ruby On Rails, and this has been an ongoing, expanding project ever since.

However, he has been dabbling with programming since getting a ZX81 for Christmas 1981, when computers came with a printed manual which, in this case, was a full training course in Sinclair BASIC. After typing lots of programs in from magazines and programming a few simple games, his first 'serious' project was on the ZX Spectrum in around 1982: his father collected football coupons for Vernon's Pools and he write software to calculate his total takings and commission.

Outside of computers, he has been teaching theatre, from primary schools and youth groups up to undergraduate, for more than 30 years and has written two books on the subject: *Practical Drama* (2002 and 2006) and *The Theatre Makers* (2008), both published by Studymates. He also has a BA (hons) in Theatre Studies from Rose Bruford College and an MA in scriptwriting from University of Glamorgan. He currently teaches undergraduates at [Rose Bruford College](https://www.bruford.ac.uk/) and drama workshops for [Mainstream Theatre Arts](https://mainstreamstudios.co.uk/).
